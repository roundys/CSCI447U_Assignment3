The most challenging part of this project was getting the SSL certificates correctly in the Fargate deployment. We used the professor's help along with online resources to solve that.

Unfortunately, we were not able to get around to switching to DynamoDB. We wanted to focus on the Docker/ECS Fargate area of the project so that we could get it up and running first, and we ran out of time.
